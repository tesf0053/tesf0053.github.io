    <h2>About Me</h2>  
    <p>My name is Samuel Tesfaye. I originally came from Ethiopia and moved to Canada in 2019. Currently, 
        I am attending my education at Algonquin College. I am very interested in Wed developing and Designing.
         Also, I am interested in photography and videography. That is why I chose the Interactive Media Design program. </p>
    <p>And I have a plan to upgrade myself in the area of <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> and graphics designing. 
        This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year program and, I <em>hope</em> I will be successful and finish the program successfully.
