    <p>My name is Samuel Tesfaye. I originally came from Ethiopia and moved to Canada in 2019. Currently, I am attending my education at Algonquin College. I am very interested in Web developing and designing. Also, I am interested in photography and videography. That is why I chose the Interactive Media Design program.</p>
    <p>And I have a plan to upgrade myself in the area of <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> and graphics designing. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year program and, I <em>hope</em> I will be successful and finish the program successfully.</p> <blockquote>To become really good at anything, you have to practice and repeat, practice
